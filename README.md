# Aim of The project
This project aims to enhance my understanding of robotics principles such as manipulator design that relies on forward and inverse kinematics, path planing and other concepts.
Moreover incorporating computer vison using OpenCV and pillow libraries to differentiate between colours.

Since I am currently learnig ROS2 I will be learning how to simulate robots using ROS2 and Gazebo.

The project can be devided into several steps:
* Modeling of the arm on solidworks
* 3D printing the model (on my 3D printer)/assembly
* Use of forward and inverce kinematics equation to derive the model of the arm
* Use matlab to validate and control the arm (along with simscape where the solidworls model will be used)
* Motion generation
* Color detection

# Digital Twin
I generated the URDF file of the arm and used it to create a visualization for the robot in Rviz and Gazebo. The robotic arm was also configured using moveit and a hardware interface with arduino was developed.
